    <h1>RadioPlatform - A Platform for Radio Amateurs</h1>
    <p>RadioPlatform is an Angular platform thought for radio amateurs to have a safe place to chat and manage their next purchase of equipment.</p>
    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <p>Users can share antennae used for their equipment, along with transceivers they may use, and make it known to other radio amateurs.</p>
<p>Users can chat, where they can ask for advice, find buying options among other radio-amateur related topics.</p>
<p>Users have a list of users they can filter by country, equipment, antennae, preferred frequency range... When they search for contacts.</p>
<p>Users have a map where they can see at a quick glance all the contacts they have neatly shown in the 'Contacts' section.</p>
<p>Users can set their favoured frequency and let other users know when they start transmitting and when.</p>
<p>    Users can give a price to equipment and make simple calculations to know whether they can afford it or not.</p>
<p>    Admins can moderate the chat with several tools that will allow for it.</p>
