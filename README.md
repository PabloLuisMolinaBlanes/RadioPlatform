# RadioPlatform - A Platform for Radio Amateurs

RadioPlatform is an Angular platform thought for radio amateurs to have a safe place to chat and manage their next purchase of equipment.

# Objectives
* Users can share antennae used for their equipment, along with transceivers they may use, and make it known to other radio amateurs.
* Users can chat, where they can ask for advice, find buying options among other radio-amateur related topics.
* Users have a list of users they can filter by country, equipment, antennae, preferred frequency range... When they search for contacts.
* (Maybe not) Users have a map where they can see at a quick glance all the contacts they have neatly shown in the 'Contacts' section.
* Users can set their favoured frequency and let other users know when they start transmitting and when.
* Users can give a price to equipment and make simple calculations to know whether they can afford it or not.
* Admins can moderate the chat with several tools that will allow for it.

# Technologies
RadioPlatform will use several technologies to accomplish its objectives.
* Ionic and Angular for the frontend.
* MySQL for holding the maps data.
* Firebase Storage for holding users' pictures.
* Firebase Database for holding users' data.
